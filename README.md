# Voice-Based-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is an end-to-end Voice-Based Sentiment Analysis system that converts spoken reviews into text and predicts whether the sentiment is Positive or Negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how classical NLP + ML models can be integrated with voice automation to build practical, real-world AI applications.
